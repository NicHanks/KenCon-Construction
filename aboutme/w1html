    <p>I came from a lovely little town called Logan. 
        It was great, it had all four seasons in the 
        year, but it was missing one thing,
        and that was BYUI... 
        I am headed for a career in tech, 
        and love to play around with tech as a hobby.
        I'm single and used to do construction.
        I am pursuing a BS degree. </p>
        <p>I am interested in starting my own free lancing
        business in web development. The advantages of 
        tech is that tech businesses are more scalable 
        than other businesses, have a lower start up cost
        than other buisness, and are also way more exciting 
        than other businesses! </p>
        <p>I have been a member of the church for 13 years
        and have many favorite scriptures, one of which 
        is Helaman 5:12 that says to build upon a strong 
        foundation.
